v42 30/11/2018  testRPC and unittesting with pytest
    non-trivial, because Web3.TestRPCProvider() can be started but not ended again, raised an issue
    for now: something (and that can be testrpc-py) has to be manually started before "py.test -v"
    wrote most tests for clienttools.py, clienttype.py, tps.py 

v41 29/11/2018  experiments with testrpc-py https://pypi.org/project/eth-testrpc/ 
    = got it running, but odd timestamps, see https://github.com/pipermerriam/eth-testrpc/issues/117
    would be nice to use for the unittesting

v40 29/11/2018  initial cleaning while planning methodology chapter; 
    make more readable, remove obsolete code, add some TODOs
