v43 5/12/2018- 
    Reog everything into subfolders for better overview
      docs & results for human readable, 
      networks for scripts to configure and start several nodes, and
      chainhammer for the core code
    BUT now all links are broken, sorry refactoring had to be done;
     do this to find the old structure: 
      git checkout f7d9e81e4ce9f81d3ad3ad67b7f92c477b9b7419
      TODO - make this a release tag perhaps
    Initial skeleton for run.sh

v42 30/11/2018 - 4/12/2018  
    testRPC and unittesting with pytest - non-trivial, because
     Web3.TestRPCProvider() can be started but not ended again, raised an issue;
    Something (can be testrpc-py) has to be manually started before "py.test -v"
     --> new compound testing script 'pytest.sh', which keeps logs & shows color.
    Altogether 64 tests for 
     clienttools, clienttype, tps, deploy, send, blocksDB_create, blocksDB_diagramming
    All 64 PASSED on testrpc-py, quorum IBFT, geth-dev, parity instantseal & aura!
     incl tps.loopUntil_NewContract (because loop) needed clever 2 threads approach 
    Selected coverage only using .coveragerc
    Issue: parity aura has no balance, send 0
    and much more ... 
    Unittesting is ~ready, hooray.

v41 29/11/2018  experiments with testrpc-py https://pypi.org/project/eth-testrpc/ 
    = got it running, but odd timestamps, see https://github.com/pipermerriam/eth-testrpc/issues/117
    would be nice to use for the unittesting

v40 29/11/2018  initial cleaning while planning methodology chapter; 
    make more readable, remove obsolete code, add some TODOs
