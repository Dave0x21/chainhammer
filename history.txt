"Testing in the cloud; docker problems; much documentation; terminator layout. Testing: Done!"
    documententation update reproduce.md is MUCH easier now; 
      must accelerate = simply moved old stuff to reproduce_outdated.md for now
    crosslinking some manual files. Now: reproduce.md + FAQ.md + cloud.md + results/
    different timezone on cloud machine, updated tests
    scripts/remove-all-docker.sh can now also run silent, without waiting for confirmation
    tried much, but docker install needs logout&login for the user to have docker access
    more testing around install-docker.sh
    temp: OPTIONALLY remove all docker before EACH experiment, to save diskspace
          later removed gain, unnecessary complexity, just use larger disk instead
    bash-script problems: always "$x" all variables $x, because if $x= empty then comparison fails otherwise
    FAQ.md 
        started long list of troubleshooting advice in FAQ.md
        'could not find an available, non-overlapping IPv4 address pool' stupidly caused by local vpn !
        TOC for FAQ
    Quorum OFF by default because too much RAM for t2.micro; ON with switch CH_QUORUM=true
    more versatile and consistent checking for and killing of leftovers
    now always same port :8545 everywhere!
    parity instantseal tps.py had incomplete knowledge about peakTpsAv, now also searches backwards
    all networks/*-stop.sh now also do docker-compose down, for full takedown
    installation chapters clearer
    timeout deploy.py on Quorum small machines; extended, now prints: "Receipt arrived. Took 35.1 seconds" 
    measured: 27 minutes for 125,000 transactions on 5 Ethereum providers, for _large.sh 
    'terminator' 
         layout for 6 ssh chainhammer info terminals in one window, REALLY useful.
         screenshot terminator
    v55: Testing in the cloud - done.

v54 23/1/2019 
"Tests before next release: all 98 unit tests PASSED on 5 network types"
    reminder: link-checker.sh has to be run when upstreamed into public repo
    unittests: 98 tests PASSED on TestRPC
    solved problems when interrupted: killing more leftovers, docker containers, etc
    TODO: perhaps also docker-compose down consistently as part of each -stop.sh? not only -clean.sh
    fix for quorum path
    fix for request.get() not allowed in parity instantseal
    v54: all 98 unittests PASSED on all 5 Ethereum providers

v53 23/1/2019 
"documentation updates"
    moved much from main README.md into docs/FAQ.md
    docs/FAQ.md added chapters: how to clone from gitlab, how to kill processes, docker, etc
    docs/FAQ.md table of contents = TOC
    extended docs/TODO.md extended e.g. with had-to-be-postponed ideas
    main README.md is much shorter now, much easier to grasp
    tried out everything on Laptop, fixed some occuring issues
    running an initial experiment needs only TWO lines now!

v52 18/1/2019-23/1/2019 
"full automation! run-all_{small,large}.sh; many github issues; tweaked many details"
    parity double-// in web3.node.version
    parity instantseal TODO: integer-seconds blocktime not right
    parity instantseal now treated like TestRPC: no empty blocks
    many github interactions, parity team; testing parity-deploy, my own scripts
    numTransactions not via config.py anymore, for scripting several experiments
    more elegant send.py log output, mention ROUTE only once
    tuned killing network starters; parity, quorum
    parity-deploy still causes many issues, my own workarounds
    new scripts for listing and killing background processes
    quorum-configure.sh easy now that blk.io merged my pull request
    many little improvements, around running experiment & results output
    finalTpsAv needed cleverer dict access
    new script to run 5 experiments with different clients all in one go!
    ./run-all_small.sh for integration testing and 
    ./run-all_large.sh to create all results per one machine

v51 15/1/2019 
"automation of network-configure/start/stop/clean; run.sh now ~complete"
    tried out parity v2.2.3 - but still not able to survive multithreaded sending
    16 (!) new scripts, see folder networks/ 
    for -start, -stop, -clean of geth, parity aura/instantseal, quorum, and testrpc!
    for -configure of parity instantseal, and aura; still TODO: geth and quorum
    run.sh can call *-start.sh and *-stop.sh scripts when given a 2nd parameter
    run.sh 1st parameter now sane to be used as part of filename
    ./run.sh is now a complete experiment launcher !

v50 14/1/2019-15/1/2019 
"results page generator; TestRPC fix; include all TpS measurements; more automation"
    new page_generator.py which makes a markdown and an HTML page from each run
    formatting issues, improved looks
    page also contains whole infodict, better safe than sorry.
    TestRPC has no empty blocks --> fix blocksDB_create/diagramming.py
    fixed issue with finalTpsAv
    diagramming also stores its blocktimesTpsAv result
    updated tests
    image-filename now also contains time-of-experiment-start to avoid overwriting
    run.sh now starts with ./is_up.py and ends with ./page_generator.py

v49 11/1/2019-13/1/2019
"whole experiment in 1 line: run.sh, and new INFOFILE across all steps. Got paid!"
    run.sh = 
    virtualenv + tps.py + deploy.py + send.py + blocksDB_create.py + blocksDB_diagramming.py
    AUTOSTOP_TPS: tps.py can be stopped now, by send.py writing to last-experiment.json
    last-experiment.json contains crucial information, e.g. range of blocks
    now also as carrier of block range info into blocksBD_create/diagramming.py
    better last-experiment.json with more infos
    clienttype.py now also nodeVersion
    Web3Foundation has paid! Mention in LICENSE and README.md#credits

v48 7/1/2019-10/1/2019
"rewritten diagrams generator"
    new diagramming; study matplotlib.plyplot, then start anew
    first as jupyter notebook, then merged into blocksDB_diagramming.py
    better appearance, scatter instead of box plots, for blocksize and blocktime
    better statistics: Now averages only over experiment blocks
    averages printed but also shown as horizontal lines
    now always 10 blocks at the end, to show averages 

v47 4/1/2019
"find out real range of experiment block numbers, and is_up.py"
    recognize known nodeNames, mention when new one
    is_up.py loops until network is reachable
    getReceipts_multithreaded now also as multithreading queue
    when_last_ones_mined__give_range_of_block_numbers() waits until all receipts are there,
    from beginning and end of experiment - and infers the range of blocknumbers the txs are in
    
v46 3/1/2019
"transaction success tester, and misc improvements"
    show peak TPS_average, and memorize after 3 relaxation rounds
    new switch PARITY_ALREADY_UNLOCKED
    cleaned up config.py a bit, more consistent naming, ...
    adapt tests to code changes
    fixed: account-passphrase.txt now also found within tests with Geth
    new GAS_FOR_SET_CALL constant
    remember all sent transaction hashes
    transaction success/failure checker, via random sample of txs
    criterion txReceipt.status OR gasUsed/gasGiven comparison

v45 2/1/2019
"better installation routines"
    installer script v45 = refactored into 6 separate install-XYZ.sh scripts
    upgraded all hardcoded versions (docker, pip, requirements.txt, etc)
    new beginning cloud machine, 
    tested the new install.sh locally and in the cloud


2018:


v44 17/12/2018
    installer script v44 = replaces whole top half of reproduce.md !
      cd chainhammer; scripts/install.sh

v43 5/12/2018-16/12/2018
    Reorg everything into subfolders for better overview
      docs & results for human readable, 
      networks & scripts for starting several nodes, and helper scripts,
      hammer & reader for the core chainhammer & chainreader code,
    BUT now links are broken, sorry refactoring had to be done;
     do this to find the old structure: 
      git checkout f7d9e81e4ce9f81d3ad3ad67b7f92c477b9b7419
      TODO - make this a release tag perhaps?
    Initial skeleton for run.sh
    code: import & path changes, so that tests were still running PASSED
    new tool scripts/link-checker.sh which finds all broken links in .md files. 
    had to fix 150 or so links in *.md files after reorg
    overview intros for parity.md geth.md quorum.md etc.
    virtualenv now simply in env/

v42 30/11/2018 - 4/12/2018  
    testRPC and unittesting with pytest - non-trivial, because
     Web3.TestRPCProvider() can be started but not ended again, raised an issue;
    Something (can be testrpc-py) has to be manually started before "py.test -v"
     --> new compound testing script 'pytest.sh', which keeps logs & shows color.
    Altogether 64 tests for 
     clienttools, clienttype, tps, deploy, send, blocksDB_create, blocksDB_diagramming
    All 64 PASSED on testrpc-py, quorum IBFT, geth-dev, parity instantseal & aura!
     incl tps.loopUntil_NewContract (because loop) needed clever 2 threads approach 
    Selected coverage only using .coveragerc
    Issue: parity aura has no balance, send 0
    and much more ... 
    Unittesting is ~ready, hooray.

v41 29/11/2018  experiments with testrpc-py https://pypi.org/project/eth-testrpc/ 
    = got it running, but odd timestamps, see https://github.com/pipermerriam/eth-testrpc/issues/117
    would be nice to use for the unittesting

v40 29/11/2018  initial cleaning while planning methodology chapter; 
    make more readable, remove obsolete code, add some TODOs
