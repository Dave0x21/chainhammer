v42 30/11/2018  testRPC and unittesting with pytest - non-trivial, because
    Web3.TestRPCProvider() can be started but not ended again, raised an issue;
    something (can be testrpc-py) has to be manually started before "py.test -v"
    --> new compound testing script 'pytest.sh', which keeps logs & shows color
    altogether 64 tests for 
    clienttools, clienttype, tps, deploy, send, blocksDB_create, blocksDB_diagramming
    all PASSED on testrpc-py, quorum IBFT, geth-dev, parity instantseal & aura!
    tps.loopUntil_NewContract because loop needed clever 2 threads approach 
    selected coverage only using .coveragerc; parity aura has no balance, send 0
    and much more ... unittesting is ~ready, hooray.

v41 29/11/2018  experiments with testrpc-py https://pypi.org/project/eth-testrpc/ 
    = got it running, but odd timestamps, see https://github.com/pipermerriam/eth-testrpc/issues/117
    would be nice to use for the unittesting

v40 29/11/2018  initial cleaning while planning methodology chapter; 
    make more readable, remove obsolete code, add some TODOs
