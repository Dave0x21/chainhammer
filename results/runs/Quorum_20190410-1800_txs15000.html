<h2>(Quorum-IBFT_Azure-testnet-jtessera) Quorum v1.8.12 with 15000 txs: 95.0 TPS</h2>

<h3>information:</h3>
<PRE>NODE: Geth/v1.8.12-stable/linux-amd64/go1.10.8 on https://jtessera.blockchain.azure.com:3200/fqlf6UcrcBJPQjoX5RkAx3Nv
      consensus=istanbul chain_name=??? chain_id=-1 network_id=1337
SEND: 15000 transactions in blocks 213799-213830 with 10 empty blocks following.
      A sample of transactions looked as if they: succeeded.
TPS:  The stopclock watcher measured a final TPS of 87.8 since contract deploy,
      and in between saw values as high as 88.2 TPS.
DIAG: The whole experiment was prefixed 'Quorum-IBFT_Azure-testnet-jtessera'.
      The diagrams were saved into 'img/Quorum-IBFT_Azure-testnet-jtessera-20190410-1800_blks213799-213830.png'.
      Looking only at the experiment block-timestamps, the overall TPS was ~95.0.
