# eos PoA benchmarking

## invitation
The github user `@eosclassicteam` has invited `chainhammer` to benchmark eosclassic, 
see [post 1](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/issues/17447#issuecomment-415486092) 
and [post 2](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/issues/17447#issuecomment-415705182).

## on pause

1. They don't have a dockerized/virtualbox-vagrant setup yet, so I [suggested that in an issue]().  
1. As we [already have results for the  PoA algorithm Clique](geth.md), I am not going to benchmark EOS now; but their second post reads as if they are also planning to improve Clique - then it might be worthwhile.

## you
Feel free to run thost benchmarks yourself now - see [quickstart](README.md#quickstart).
